**TEMPLATE-PLUS** is a private, high-signal collection of premium Nuclei templates curated exclusively for professional penetration testing, red team operations, bug bounty hunting, and enterprise-grade automated security assessments.

This repository contains heavily optimized, low-false-positive, and stealth-oriented templates that significantly outperform the public `nuclei-templates` collection. Every template is battle-tested in real-world engagements and continuously refined for maximum accuracy, evasion, and operational impact.
